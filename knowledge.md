### Architecture
- **main.cpp**: Creates all components, registers command handlers, runs main loop
  - **Initializes Winsock once for entire program** (WSAStartup/WSACleanup)
  - Gets singleton instances of InputHandler and CommandDispatcher
  - Gets singleton instances of SecureShell and SubnetScanner (both via getInstance())
  - Auto-registration happens on getInstance() calls for tool commands
- **vToolCommand**: CRTP base template for tool commands
  - Provides singleton pattern via getInstance()
  - Auto-registers commands with CommandDispatcher on first use
  - Uses static constexpr for command metadata (COMMAND_PHRASE, COMMAND_TIP)
  - Virtual handleCommand() for runtime polymorphism
  - Enforces design contract at compile time via template instantiation
  - Protected save_results() method for file output (bare bones implementation)
- **CommandDispatcher**: Static class dispatcher with built-in help/quit/exit
  - Static class pattern: All methods and data are static, no instances
  - Initialize with `CommandDispatcher::initialize()`
  - Access methods directly: `CommandDispatcher::processCommand()`, `CommandDispatcher::registerCommand()`
  - All commands use uniform interface: `bool(const std::vector<std::string>&)`
  - Splits input into words, removes command name, passes arguments to handlers
  - Self-registers help/quit/exit as fundamental commands
  - Help command auto-lists all registered commands with tips
  - **Logging integration**: Initializes LoggingStreambuf and redirects cout
    - Currently logs ALL commands including built-ins (unintended)
    - TODO: Move logging to vToolCommand for selective logging
- **LoggingStreambuf**: Standalone logging class that inherits from std::streambuf
  - Duplicates cout output to timestamped log files
  - Owns file lifecycle via unique_ptr<ofstream>
  - Creates directory structure: `logs/YYYYMMDD/command_HHMMSS.txt`
  - Auto-creates directories using std::filesystem
  - Real-time file flushing for immediate output
  - Thread-safe design for future multi-command scenarios
  - TODO: Instantiate per vToolCommand instead of globally
- **InputHandler**: Singleton thread-safe command input system (queue-based)
  - Singleton pattern: Lazy initialization, thread-safe since C++11
  - Access via `InputHandler::getInstance()`
  - Private constructor, deleted copy constructor/assignment operator
- **SecureShell** (formerly SSHConnection): Barebones libssh2 implementation
  - Direct libssh2 API usage (no ssh.exe)
  - Password authentication only
  - Simple connect/execute/disconnect model
  - Inherits from vToolCommand<SecureShell> for singleton pattern
  - Uses static constexpr for command metadata (COMMAND_PHRASE, COMMAND_TIP)
  - Has handleCommand() method for CommandDispatcher integration
  - Requires: libssh2 library
  - **Important**: Proper channel cleanup required between commands (send_eof, wait_eof, wait_closed)
- **SubnetScanner**: Network subnet scanning and host discovery
  - Inherits from vToolCommand<SubnetScanner> for singleton pattern
  - Uses static constexpr for command metadata (COMMAND_PHRASE = "scan")
  - Handles CIDR notation parsing (supports both / and \ delimiters)
  - Converts IP addresses to binary representation (uint32_t)
  - Creates subnet masks from CIDR notation
  - Generates address ranges for scanning
  - Refactored architecture: Separated CIDR parsing from scanning logic
  - **Ping implementation**: Windows ICMP API (work-stealing thread pool)
    - Uses IcmpSendEcho for host discovery
    - **Threading model**: Work-stealing thread pool pattern
      - Fixed pool of 100 threads created upfront
      - Atomic index for work distribution (`fetch_add` for thread safety)
      - Each thread pulls work until queue empty
      - ICMP handle created inside each thread (avoids reference capture issue)
    - Retry logic: 3 attempts per host, 500ms timeout each
    - Mutex protection for console output and Host_Statuses map
    - Uses emplace_back to avoid thread copy construction
    - 5ms delay between thread spawns (reduced from 25ms)
  - **Data structures**:
    - `Host_Addresses`: Vector of all IPs to scan
    - `Host_Statuses`: Map tracking ping results (address -> bool)
    - Public members for network info access
  - Has handleCommand() method for CommandDispatcher integration
  - Command: `scan <cidr>` (e.g., scan 192.168.1.0/24)
  - Requires linking: -lws2_32 -liphlpapi
- User preference: No unnecessary abstraction layers (rejected Application class)

### Code Style
- **Refer to code-style.md for all styling decisions**
- User wants no magic numbers - always use named constants
- Simple, widely-accepted C++ conventions

### Key Code Patterns
- **Guard clauses**: Use early returns/continue to flatten nested code
- **Refactoring for clarity**: Extract wait/prompt logic to separate functions
- **Buffer reuse**: Pass buffers to avoid repeated allocations
- **Function naming**: User renamed executeMultipleCommands to executeShell (more accurate)
- **Constants**: User adds descriptive constants like CHECK_INTERVAL_MS with comments
- **Code organization**: Implementation details go in helper functions, main flow stays clean
- **Magic value elimination**: Replace hardcoded chars with named constant arrays (PROMPT_ENDINGS)
- **Scalable patterns**: Use loops/arrays instead of hardcoded conditionals for extensibility

### Important Functions/Classes
- **InputHandler**: Fire-and-forget detached thread, runs for process lifetime
  - Singleton instance accessed via `getInstance()`
  - No explicit lifecycle management needed
  - Leverages OS process cleanup
  - Private constructor prevents direct instantiation
- **CommandDispatcher**: Central command routing system
  - Static class - all methods accessed directly (no instances)
  - Call `initialize()` once at startup
  - Manages command registration and execution

## User Preferences & Patterns
- **KISS principle** - Don't add code for future scenarios
- No premature abstraction or "future enhancement" comments
- **Documentation discipline**: Expects continuous updates to markdown files
- **Refactoring style**: Extract complex logic, use guard clauses, flatten nesting
- **Function naming**: Prefers accurate names (executeShell vs executeMultipleCommands)
- **Code reviews**: Will call out when documentation isn't being maintained

## Technical Considerations
- Windows ssh.exe has crypto restrictions that affect legacy device connections
- May need libssh2 for better legacy SSH support without system modifications
- User wants concise responses
- User wants me to maintain context via this file
- Working environment: Windows, OneDrive synced
- Update knowledge.md silently with every prompt when relevant
- Keep information density high - no fluff
- Don't create noise about updates
- Prefers organized folder structure (classes in own folders)
- Makes own code formatting adjustments - observe and adapt
- **Code style**: Self-documenting, verbose variable names over brevity
- Prefers code that "flows naturally" - readable over dense
- **IMPORTANT**: User does NOT want test builds - just write the code correctly

## User Background & Role
- Industrial systems software engineer
- Bachelor's in Computer Engineering
- Strong CS theory & hardware architecture knowledge
- Experienced with engineering solutions
- **My Role**: C++ mentor/guide - help with syntax, idioms, best practices
- **NOT**: Don't architect or over-engineer - user handles design decisions
- Teach C++ patterns as senior engineer would

## Critical Notes
- **Must maintain documentation**: User explicitly requires updating knowledge.md, code-style.md, and project-log.md throughout work
- **SSH device limitation**: Some network devices only allow one channel per session - use shell mode for multiple commands

## Cleanup/Polish Task Checklist
**Trigger phrase**: "cleanup", "polish", or similar
**Purpose**: Systematic code quality improvements without changing functionality

### Always Check:
1. **Header Guards**
   - Ensure all headers use proper include guards matching their filename
   - Format: `HEADER_NAME_H` (e.g., `SUBNET_SCANNER_H` for SubnetScanner.h)
   - Never use pragma once (prefer traditional guards)

2. **Include Optimization**
   - Remove duplicate includes between .h and .cpp files
   - Remove unused includes (especially `<thread>`, `<mutex>` if not used)
   - Add required includes for types (e.g., `<cstdint>` for uint32_t)
   - Header files should only include what they directly need
   - Implementation files should not re-include what's in their header
   - **Windows headers**: ALWAYS include `<winsock2.h>` before `<windows.h>` to avoid conflicts

3. **Naming Consistency**
   - Private member variables: check for m_ prefix or snake_case consistency
   - Function names: camelCase (some use snake_case - standardize)
   - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
   - Fix any typos (e.g., subnet_cider â†’ subnet_cidr)

4. **Code Organization**
   - Ensure consistent spacing and indentation (4 spaces)
   - Remove unnecessary blank lines
   - Add blank lines between logical sections
   - Ensure consistent brace style

5. **Comments & Documentation**
   - Remove or update outdated comments
   - Ensure inline comments are meaningful
   - Update documentation files if behavior changed

6. **Const Correctness**
   - Mark methods const where appropriate
   - Use const parameters where values shouldn't change
   - Check return types for unnecessary const on primitives
   - **Pass by const reference**: Convert `const std::string` and `const std::vector` parameters to `const&` to avoid copies

7. **Error Messages**
   - Ensure all error messages are clear and consistent
   - Use consistent capitalization in output messages

8. **Magic Numbers**
   - Replace any remaining magic numbers with named constants
   - Document any non-obvious constant values

9. **Parameter Optimization**
   - Pass objects (string, vector, custom classes) by const reference instead of value
   - Keep primitives (int, uint32_t, bool, char) as pass-by-value
   - Check for unnecessary copying in function parameters

### Quick Checks:
- Run build to ensure no warnings
- Check for TODO/FIXME comments that can be addressed
- Verify all files end with newline
- Check for trailing whitespace
